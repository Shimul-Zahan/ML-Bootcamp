# ML Bootcamp

Welcome to the **ML Bootcamp** repository! This repository is a personal learning hub where I document my progress, projects, and notes related to Machine Learning. It includes hands-on exercises, code snippets, and solutions to various ML problems as I explore different concepts and techniques.

## About

This repository serves as a learning and practice space for foundational and advanced Machine Learning topics. By building projects and solving practical problems, I aim to strengthen my understanding of:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms
- Deep learning concepts and neural networks
- Natural language processing (NLP)
- Time series forecasting and clustering techniques

## Topics Covered

- Linear Regression and Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs
- Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis
- Data Visualization and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ML-Bootcamp.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ML-Bootcamp
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Explore project folders and notebooks for learning materials.
